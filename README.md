# CS-289-Final-Project

This Github contains the data and python notebooks necessary to replicate the analysis laid out in our final project. While the findings are summarized within our final report, the notebooks conatined here allow for a more detailed walkthrough of the steps we took on this project.

The layout of the github is as follows:

1) The Data folder contains all necessary data needed to run the accompanying notebooks.  All data should be stored locally in the same directory as the notebook you are running.

2) The Notebooks folder contains all of the notebooks used to carry out our analysis. Within this folder there will be subfolders for each sub analysis we conducted. Within those documents you can find further README's that will explain what each notebook accomplishes and how to interact with it.
