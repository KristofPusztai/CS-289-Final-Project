# EDA
This Folder contains some of the notebooks we used for our exploratory data analysis. 

## DATA.ipynd
Data generation notebook - please do not run this notebook, we have provided all necessary data in the data file of the repository.  The code requires manual intervention to attain the proper data
In addtion the data gathering take a long time to run.

## Fourier Preidction.ipynb
Fourier Prediction - This note book is ready for a user to run, it explores the planetary epicycloids from a a frequency prespective. After downloading the necessary functions, each cell peforms computes the MSE for each the model using the top k frequencies. The k frequencies are the hyperparameter of interest.
This notebook lends insight into the static shape of the cycles and the need to model the angle of rotation between epicycles.
