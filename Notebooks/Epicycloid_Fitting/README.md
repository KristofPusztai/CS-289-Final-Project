# An Experimental Approach: Fitting an Epicycloid

This folder contains all the code relevant to the section "An Experimental Approach: Fitting an Epicycloid"

### Epicycloid_Demo.ipynb
Running through this file will demonstrate the following:
1. Processing and reducing the dimensionality of data
2. Fitting epicycloid equations to training data
3. Predicting using our epicycloid parameters and comparing it to test data

### epicycloid_gd.py
This file contains all the functions that are used for gradient descent, fitting, predicting, and doing cost analysis.

### epicycloid_process_data.py
This file mostly contains helper functions for processing data as well as the necessary functions for doing dimensionality reduction.
